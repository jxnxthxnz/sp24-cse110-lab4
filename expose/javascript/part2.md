4. This function returns discounted but nothing appears on the console because you aren't console.log()
5. Since you used a let declaration for i, there is a ReferenceError as i is not defined
6. Since you used a let declaration for discounted, there is a ReferenceError as discountedPrice is not defined

a. student.name \
b. student['Grad Year'] \
c. student.greeting() \
d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name \
e. student.courseLoad[0] 

a. '32' since integers map to their exact string representation \
b. 1 since the string is converted to an integer to do subtraction \
c. 3 since null is equal to nothing  \
d. '3null' since null becomes the string 'null'  \
e. 4 since true maps to 1 \
f. 0 both map to 0 \
g. '3undefined' since undefined becomes the string 'undefined' \
h. NaN since one is a string and the other is an undefined value and the math is not possible 

a. True since integer 2 is larger than 1 \
b. False since the string '12' should be before '2' \
c. True since 2 is equal to 2 \
d. False since the types of the 2's are different \
e. False since 1 is not equal to 2 \
f. True since Boolean(2) is also equal to true

== checks if the value is equal irregardless of type. === is more strict as it checks if both the value and type are equal. 

The result will be [2, 4, 6], and you can verify through console.log. The function works by iterating through each element of the array and doubling its value via the callback function before returning the new array with all the new values.
